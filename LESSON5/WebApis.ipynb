    "# Part 1. Essentials Before We Code\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "### What is an API?\n",
    "\n",
    "API stands for **Application Programming Interface**. It is a code-based functionality that accomplishes a task. That task could be text to speech, displaying an IPython widget, or simpling `print()`ing a string. \n",
    "\n",
    "You have been consuming API's all along in this course. Every time we import a Python module we are adding other people's code to our programs, and consuming their API. In addition, the built in Python string functions like `startswith()` and `upper()` are part of Pythons internal API. If we want to convert a string to upper case, we don't have to write that code ourselves, we can just use the built in string API! In addition when you write your own functions you are building your own API, although its limited to interfacing with yourself. \n",
    "\n",
    "What makes Python so great is there are many useful API's built into the language. There is also a website, called the Python Package Index https://pypi.org/ where you can find other API's and then install them into your Python environment using the pip utility.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Web API?\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply put, a **web API** expands on an API by exposing this functionality over the Internet. API's like getting the [current weather](https://open-meteo.com/), [finding a location on the globe](https://nominatim.org/) or using [Chat GPT in your application](https://openai.com/product) are common Web APIs. These types of functions require massive amounts of data and compute capacity, which is impractical to run on our computers and smartphones. Web API's run **in the cloud**, which is a way of saying they are hosted on the Internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Technologies like smarphone apps and Chat GPT would not be possible without web APIs, as most of the actual \"smartness\" in these technologies runs in the cloud and is exposed to the computer programs on our smartphones as web APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In the simplest of terms, and API can be thought of as a function call. Therefore think of a web api as making that same function call over the internet.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Evolution of the web API\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, the web focused on the direct user-consumption of information. We used a browser and search engine to get the news, sports scores, watch youtube or get the latest weather forecast. We did not need web API's because all of this consumption took place in a web browser, and the services we used could just send us HTML, which our browser rendered into nice looking webpages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The emergence of smart devices like watches, phones, media players, and intelligent speakers has caused a shift in the web from user-based to device-based. Most of the information we consume nowadays is no longer in a browser, but instead on a variety of devices. We watch movies on our Roku players, check the news and sports scores on our smart phones, or get weather reports from Alexa. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When we use an app on our smartphone to get stock quotes, a web API is delivering data to the app on our phone. The app is then displaying the information on our screen.\n",
    "- When we ask Alexa to play a song, Web API will search for the the song (on Spotify for example) and return back information about the song including how the speaker can play it.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might think you need to know a lot about networking to call a web API, but actually **HTTP (Hyptertext Transport Protocol)** handles most of the details for you. HTTP is the protocol that makes the web work. You do need to understand some basics of HTTP in order to correctly consume web API's.\n"
   ]

   "source": [
    "## 1.2 Understanding HTTP\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hyptertext Transport Protocol (HTTP) is the means by which hosts on the web communicate. Within the context of a web API, it is the mechanisim by which the API is called. Using web standards this way is smart because it means someone can program the web API in one language but it can be used in a different language.  The communication occurs in a request/response pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "- An **HTTP request** is sent by the client to the cloud and consists of a **URL** or Uniform Resource Locator, a **HTTP Verb**, and forms of input like a **Query String**, **Body**, or **Headers**.\n",
    "- An **HTTP response** is sent from the cloud to the client and consists of a **Status Code** and a **Response Body**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down these components, using the same anology of **input -> process -> output.** and the metaphors we know from function calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "### HTTP Request (Calling the web API)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **HTTP Request** this is the equivalent of initiating a function call, only the function you're calling is in the cloud! The request components consist of a **URL**, a **HTTP Verb**, and one or more inputs **Query String**, **Body**, or **Headers**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### URL\n",
    "\n",
    "**URL** A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) consists of the name of the cloud resource we wish to access. This is equivalent to the name of the function you wish to call, like `pd.json_normalize()` or `split()`.  In the case of web APIs, they look like websites, for example: [https://api.tvmaze.com/search/shows](https://api.tvmaze.com/search/shows) to search TV shows, or [https://api.openweathermap.org/data/3.0/onecall](https://api.openweathermap.org/data/3.0/onecall) to get the current weather.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### HTTP Verb\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**HTTP Verb** have no analogy to a traditional function call. The HTTP Verb specifies how the cloud resource should be called. There are limitations on how much data you can send over the internet based on HTTP verb. Common verbs are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `GET` - request a resource, sending minimal amounts of data as input. For example you might send the name of the tv show you wish to search for or the city for which you'd like the weather.\n",
    "- `POST` - request a resource, sending a significant amount of data as input. For example you might send a PDF and a question to Chat GPT's api and ask it to answer your question based on the contents of the PDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other verbs like `PUT`, `DELETE`, and `PATCH`, which you likely will not encounter in this course. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inputs: Query String, Body and Headers\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three places where you can send INPUT into your HTTP request. Any request can use none or all of these forms of input.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Query String**  - Also known as **parameters**, these are a set of key/value pairs (think Python `dict`) on the URL.  For example to search for the simpsons tv show: [https://api.tvmaze.com/search/shows?q=simpsons](https://api.tvmaze.com/search/shows?q=simpsons) This is the most common method of sending inputs to a Web API.\n",
    "- **Body** - Body is used during a `POST` to send large amounts of data to the web API. You will not see the data in the URL. Body formats can be binary, JSON, or text.\n",
    "- **Headers** - The headers are another set of key/value pairs (Python `dict`). Unlike the query string, the headers do not appear on the URL. Typically access permissions are sent in the headers to inform the web API you are allowed to use it. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### HTTP Response (Result of calling the API)\n",
    "\n",
    "After you send the HTTP Request, you will get back an **HTTP response**. Consider this the values being `return`ed from the function call. The HTTP response consists of a **Status Code** and the response body itself, which will be binary (and image, for example), JSON or text. This will depend on the web API, of course.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Status Codes**\n",
    "\n",
    "When the server returns a response to a request, included in the response is the HTTP status code, which tells the client whether or not the request worked. Unlike a regular API / function call such as `print()` this is necessary because there is a lot that can go wrong.  Status codes are 3 digit numbers and the first number indicates the type of response:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `1xx` - codes are informational. These are seldom used in web APIs.\n",
    "- `2xx` - codes which begin with a 2 indicate success. The most common code is `200` - OK.\n",
    "- `3xx` - codes which begin with a 3 indicate redirection - the response is not comming from the request URL you requested. For example a `304` - Not modified means your response is coming from the browser's cache (content already downloaded).\n",
    "- `4xx` - codes which begin with a 4 indicate a client error. The most common code here is `404` - Not Found. Any `4xx` errors mean the requestor did something wrong. (In this case, that's you!)\n",
    "- `5xx` - codes which begin with a 5 indicate a server error. The most common code here is `500` - Internal server error, which indicates the server could not process the request. When this happens it could be the web API's problem or the way you made the request.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can learn more here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Response body**\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the body of the response contains the information you requested: The weather, Chat GPT's response, etc... \n",
    "\n",
    "This could be several formats, commonly binary (an image, for example), text, or JSON. If you click on this link: [https://api.tvmaze.com/search/shows?q=simpsons](https://api.tvmaze.com/search/shows?q=simpsons) you will make a web API request and see the response in your browser. This response is in JSON format. \n",
